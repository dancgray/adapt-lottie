## Settings Overview

The attributes listed below are used in *components.json* to configure **Text**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/dancgray/adapt-bodymovin/blob/master/example.json).

### Attributes

[**core model attributes**](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes): These are inherited by every Adapt component. [Read more](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes).

**_component** (string): This value must be: `bodymovin`.

**_classes** (string): CSS class name to be applied to **adapt-bodymovin**’s containing `div`. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space.

**_layout** (string): This defines the horizontal position of the component in the block. Acceptable values are `full`, `left` or `right`.  

**title** (string): A reference title for the component. **title** is distinct from the **displayTitle** which, if present, appears above the component. **title** provides the opportunity to use a shortened form in tighter spaces, such as in menus or in the drawer.

**instruction** (string): This optional text appears above the component. It is frequently used to
guide the learner’s interaction with the component.
